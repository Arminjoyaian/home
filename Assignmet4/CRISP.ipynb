In the stage of understanding the business, it is necessary to examine the different angles of that business, the limitations, the existing conditions and the goals of that business from the current project or projects. This step prepares the mind of the data scientist to work on the project and allows him to move on to the next steps with more and better knowledge. At this stage, a data science expert can master the existing business to some extent and increase his understanding of that business as much as possible."

At this stage, operations such as \"exploratory data analysis - EDA\" and making preliminary reports from the data can be very helpful. By understanding the data and understanding its different dimensions and features, different ideas can be proposed and the main structure of the project can be determined. At this stage, the quality of the data can also be evaluated and if the data is inappropriate, it can be improved with the consultation and participation of different parts of the business."
